### Short Bio
I am an [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/) postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland, and a member of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) society.
Together with [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/) I work on topics related to probabilistic machine learning, tractable models, and Bayesian deep learning.

Prior to that, I completed my PhD at Graz University of Technology, Austria, under the supervision of [Franz Pernkopf](https://www.spsc.tugraz.at/people/franz-pernkopf.html) and [Robert Peharz](https://robert-peharz.github.io/). During my PhD I was a research assistant at the [Austrian Research Institute for AI](https://www.ofai.at/) and at the [Computational and Biological Learning lab](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/) of the University of Cambridge, UK. I finished my master's degree in computational intelligence at Vienna University of Technology, Austria, and at the time was a research assistant at [VRVis](https://www.vrvis.at/).

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in (probabilistic) machine learning and artificial intelligence and have a particular interest in the following research questions:
- How can we design **tractable representations** that are useful in complex modeling scenarios?[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]
- How can we encode **meaningful assumptions** into modern machine-learning models?[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]
- How can we make our methods **adaptive** to increasing data complexity, new domains, etc. in a principled way?[^5]<sup>,</sup>[^6]

In addition to my research, I am part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) project.

### Scientific Activities
I have been involved in the organization of the following workshops: [2nd UNCV at ICCV 2023](https://uncv2023.github.io/), [1st UNCV at ECCV 2022](https://uncv2022.github.io/), [6th TPM at UAI 2023](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2023/), and [5th TPM at UAI](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2022/).
Moreover, I helped in organizing the [Nordic Probabilistic AI School 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/) and organize the ELLIS Seminar on [Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/) at Aalto University.
