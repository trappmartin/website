### Short Bio & Research Interests
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher working with Arno Solin and completed my PhD at Graz University of Technology, Austria, under Franz Pernkopf and Robert Peharz. My research is broadly centred around tractable probabilistic models (e.g., probabilistic circuits), Bayesian learning in complex models (e.g., neural networks), and Bayesian nonparametrics. I am particularly interested in (i) developing new methods that enable tractable probabilistic inference while being more expressive than probabilistic circuits and adaptive (nonparametric), and (ii) leveraging core ideas of probabilistic circuits to speed up computations in Bayesian deep learning.

In addition, I am part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) project and co-organise the ELLIS Seminar on [Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/).
