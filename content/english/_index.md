### Short Bio & Research Interests
I am currently an [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/) postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland, working together with [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/).
Prior to that, I completed my PhD at Graz University of Technology, Austria, under supervision of [Franz Pernkopf](https://www.spsc.tugraz.at/people/franz-pernkopf.html) and [Robert Peharz](https://robert-peharz.github.io/) and simultaneously worked as a research assistant at the [Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ofai.at/).

My research is broadly centred around probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and deep learning.
I am particularly interested in approaches that are **probabilistic**, **tractable**, and **adaptive**.
Consequently, I made various contributions in the field of tractable probabilistic modelling, Bayesian deep learning, and Bayesian nonparametrics.
In addition, I am part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) project.
For more details see my [academic cv](./cv.pdf).

### Scientific Activities
I have been involved in the organisation of the following workshops: [2nd UNCV at ICCV 2023](https://uncv2023.github.io/), [1st UNCV at ECCV 2022](https://uncv2022.github.io/), [6th TPM at UAI 2023](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2023/), [5th TPM at UAI](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2022/).
Moreover, I helped in organising the [Nordic Probabilistic AI School 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/) and actively organise the ELLIS Seminar on [Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/) at Aalto University.
