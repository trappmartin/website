### Short Bio
I am an [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/en/) postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland, and a member of the [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) society.
My research is centred around **representing and quantifying** uncertainties to make machine learning more **reliable**. 
I have a particular interest in **tractable and principled** approaches and in **large-scale settings** with applications in computer vision.
I conduct research together with many amazing colleagues & collaborators, and closely work with the team of my postdoc advisor [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/).

Before joining Aalto, I completed my PhD at Graz University of Technology, Austria, under the supervision of [Franz Pernkopf](https://www.spsc.tugraz.at/people/franz-pernkopf.html) and advised by [Robert Peharz](https://robert-peharz.github.io/). 
During my PhD I was simultaneously a research assistant at the [Austrian Research Institute for AI](https://www.ofai.at/) and worked for several month at the [Computational and Biological Learning lab](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/) of the University of Cambridge, UK, as research assistant.
I have been actively involved in the development of [Turing.jl](https://turinglang.org/) and remain a strong supporter of open-source software.
I finished my master's degree at the Vienna University of Technology and was a research assistant at [VRVis](https://www.vrvis.at/) at the same time.

<br/>

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning with a particular interest in **computational and principled** approaches to uncertainty representation and quantification as well as tractable inference and trustworthy machine learning. Currently, I am particularly excited about the following research questions:

- How can we represent and quantify uncertainties efficiently in large-scale systems?
- What are the limits of tractable yet expressive models and how can we push this frontier?
- How can we encode functional priors and utilize neurosymbolic reasoning in large-scale models?

<br/>

### Scientific Activities
I have been involved in the organization of the following workshops: Uncertainty Quantification in Computer Vision ([2024](https://uncv2024.github.io/), [2023](https://uncv2023.github.io/), [2022](https://uncv2022.github.io/)), and Tractable Probabilistic Modeling ([2024](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2024/), [2023](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2023/), [2022](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2022/)).
Moreover, I helped in organizing the [Nordic Probabilistic AI School 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/) and actively organize the ELLIS Seminar on [Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning (APML)](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/) at Aalto University.
