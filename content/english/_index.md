This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
# Welcome

- Hugo :rocket:
- Hugo theme :rocket:

Don't forget to check the README.md file!
```

Remember that you can also specify a section header for the posts below by configuring the `mainSectionsTitle` parameter in the front matter of this file.

### Short Bio
Currently, I am an [Academy of Finland postdoctoral researcher](https://akareport.aka.fi/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=x_hakkuvaus2&CLICKED_ON=&HAKNRO1=347279&UILANG=en&TULOSTE=HTML) postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland. Together with Arno Solin, Trevor Campbell, Guy van den Broeck, and Zoubin Ghahramani, I am developing tools for efficient computations in stochastic process models and Bayesian deep learning by utilizing core ideas of probabilistic circuits. Previously, I was a postdoc with [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/) (2020 – 2022). Before that, I finished my PhD thesis on “Sum-Product Networks for Complex Modelling Tasks” at Graz University of Technology, Austria, under the supervision of [Franz Pernkopf](https://www.spsc.tugraz.at/people/franz-pernkopf.html) and [Robert Peharz](https://robert-peharz.github.io) in 2020.

### Research Interests
I am broadly interested in principled approaches to probabilistic reasoning, uncertainty quantification, deep architectures, and nonparametric modelling families. 
Currently, I am particularly interested in pushing the frontier of **tractability** and **flexibility** by exploring techniques based on tractable models (e.g., *probabilistic circuits*), *deep learning* and *Bayesian nonparametrics*.


In addition, I am part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) project and co-organise the ELLIS Seminar on [Advances in Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://aaltoml.github.io/apml/).
