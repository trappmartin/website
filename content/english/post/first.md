I wanted to start some form of a blog or research notes for a while, and starting a fellowship like a good opportunity to learn *new things* and write them down so that *other people* can benefit from it too.
I plan to publish a post at the beginning *of every month*.

The topics I am going to write about are likely to vary, with some notes being on more fundamental topics (e.g., basics on stochastic processes) and others on more recent trends. In short, it is going to be wild. Here and there, I will try to write tutorial-like posts about *probabilistic circuits*, as people seem interested in learning more about them. These will likely showcase them from a rather pragmatic point[^1] while trying to stay as rigorous as possible.

Wish me luck!
